the core concept of OOP is to separate concerns and responsibilities into entities.

Entities are coded as objects, and each entity will group a given set of information (properties) and actions (methods) that can be performed by the entity.

OOP is very useful on large scale projects, as it facilitates code modularity and organization.

By implementing the abstraction of entities, we're able to think about the program in a similar way as our world works, with different actors that perform certain actions and interact with each other.
